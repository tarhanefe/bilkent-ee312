## Lab 1

Lab 01 focuses on investigating discrete cosine signals. Tasks include generating and storing discrete cosine signals in MATLAB, plotting these signals, and discussing their quantization and periodicity properties.

## Lab 2

Lab 02 involves computing convolutions using explicit procedures rather than built-in MATLAB commands. Students find the impulse response of a system, compute outputs analytically and numerically, and compare results.

## Lab 3

Lab 03 applies concepts of impulse response and filtering to simulate how music would sound in a music auditorium. Students record an impulse response, filter anechoic music through this response, and analyze the results.

## Lab 4

Lab 04 covers the Fourier series expansion and related approximations. Tasks include discretizing a rectangular waveform, finding its Fourier series coefficients, plotting spectra, and analyzing approximations using different numbers of Fourier components.

## Lab 5

Lab 05 involves designing a practical FIR filter, testing its frequency response, and performing filtering operations. Students design the filter based on given specifications, apply chirp signals as input, and analyze the output to understand the filterâ€™s frequency response. Additional tasks include forwarding the signal to a system loudspeaker and comparing the original and filtered signals.

## Lab 6

Lab 06 focuses on designing a practical IIR filter. Students determine the filter coefficients, generate discrete chirp signals, pass them through the IIR filter, and analyze the output. The tasks include listening to the filtered signals, plotting various graphs, and performing similar operations with digitized music and voice recordings.
